Node-RED has been separated from oe-cloud and it is now an optional module for oe-cloud based apps.

This is a meta-package for Node-RED integration with oe-cloud. 

This package needs to be added to app-list and also as a package.json dependency for integrating Node-RED with an oe-cloud based app.
